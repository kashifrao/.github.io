<font color='#2471a3'>Australian National University (Australia)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (Oct’05 ---- Date)</font><br>National Computational Infrastructure <br><br><i><u><b>OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure</i></u></b><br>Setup fully customizable Application & Database Cluster in open stack environment with complete backup and monitoring routines and have a web interface to manage. Fully automated process of moving application and database from development environment to production environment. Design a graphical web interface using Drupal for monitoring the whole architecture. All puppet configurations are properly managed through a central git repository. Database Cluster comprises of both PostgreSQL and MySQL cluster, both have management nodes, application nodes and data nodes replicating to each other. Both cluster have connection pooling and load balancer enabled.<br>URL : https://dctcms.nci.org.au<br><br><i><u><b>Persistent Identifier Service</i></u></b><br>Persistent Identifier Service (PID Service) enables resolution of persistent identifiers. The proposed solution is using an approach to intercept all incoming HTTP requests at the Apache HTTP web server level and pass it through to the PID Service dispatcher servlet that implements a logic to recognise a pattern of an incoming request and compare it with one of the patterns configured in the PID. The main purpose of PID is to store a consistent URI for the users that mapped to actual URI so there should be consistency in URI mapping. <br>URL : http://pid.nci.org.au/ <br><br><i><u><b>PROMS</i></u></b><br>Currently working on PROMS Server, an application designed to manage provenance information sent from a series of "reporting systems" which map their processes to a constrained variant of the PROV Data Model. It consists of a RESTful API (Python Flask) that both enforces data policy for incoming provenance information and also makes that information available in several ways.PROMS Server works as an application layer on top of an RDF triple store (graph database) and required a web server, such as Apache, to broker access to it online.<br>URL : http://proms.nci.org.au/ <br><br><i><u><b>Research Data Switchboard</i></u></b><br>Research Data Switchboard (RD-Switchboard) allows cross platform discovery by connecting data sets from multiple registries. It is an open, collaborative project administered by Research Data Alliance's (RD-A) DDRI Work Group. The way RD-Switchboard operates is analogous to the discovery functions featured on online bookstores such as Amazon. <br>URL : https://rd-switchboard.nci.org.au/<br><br> <i><u><b>NCI Data Collection Web Portal</i></u></b><br>URL : https://datamgt.nci.org.au/ <br><br>Currently design a software for metadata collection and publishing of metadata into Geonetwork for various projects (Geoscience Australia, AusCover, eMAST, BOM, CSIRO). The utility will provide both insertion of single metadata and also bulk insertion. There are predefined metadata profiles setup as well a general metadata profile setup which is totally customizable according to your needs. All metadata will pass through a validation tool before inserting data into the Geonetwork server. The utility aims to automate the whole process of data insertion so the user don't have to do anything manually. <br>The NCI metadata creation web portal minimizes the workload for managing metadata records and exposing through the NCI catalogue service. It is critical to manage our catalogue system to enable real-time updates, synchronization and capture the changes along the time. To ensure we can do this, we build this infrastructure under OpenStack DevOps framework so that we can easily recover the system if a node or server is down.<br>Access privilege system is based on LDAP authentication and also inbuilt user or project validation. The metadata is recorded both in Geonetwork default database as well as NCI metadata database to provide a centralized search utility. The software will also monitor all the routines and records all usage statistics based on every user or project. <br>In my current position  with  NCI, I am responsible for the administration of the database servers as well as to support and maintain all the web interfaces which were designed to support the NCI system. <br>Working on the development of computational tools and techniques. Tasks also involve real-time data management and MDS (Mass Data Storage) management, and administration, as well as writing web services and tools for Grid-Computing services and tools.<br><i>Database Administration, Specialist Programmer </i><br>I am responsible for the administration of the databases (both MySQL and postgres) running on different servers. The task involves the basic administration   of database, backup and restoration of database, monitoring database performance and importing and exporting database from one server to another. I have developed quite a few small scripts that will automate some of the above processes and monitoring the availability of all the servers 24 hours a day. <br><br><i><u><b>Geonetwork Catalogue</i></u></b><br>GeoNetwork is a catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources. It provides powerful metadata editing and search functions as well as an interactive web map viewer. It is currently used in numerous Spatial Data Infrastructure initiatives across the world. GeoNetwork provides an easy to use web interface to search geospatial data across multiple catalogs<br>For each dataset, we generate a large number of detailed attributes. For datasets, these records are stored within dedicated GeoNetwork servers. The record for the dataset will provide the search term for all dataset records and their associated attributes. If a user wishes to find specific attributes of data (e.g., sea-surface temperature) they can make a search on the relevant dataset attribute on the GeoNetwork server. <br>URL : https://geonetwork.nci.org.au<br><br><i><u><b>DOI (Data Citation)</i></u></b><br>Data citation refers to the practice of providing a reference to data in the same way as researchers routinely provide a bibliographic reference to outputs such as journal articles, reports and conference papers. A DOI is a type of persistent identifier that indicates a dataset will be well managedand accessible for long term use. With the agreement with Australian National Data Service (ANDS), NCI has the capacity of minting Digital Objective Identifiers (DOIs) for the data products published through NCI data repository. Part of the data management portal deliverable was to enable an initial DOI minting self-service.<br>URL : https://doi.nci.org.au<br><br><i><u><b>Genome Catalogue</i></u></b><br>Genome sequencing (also known as WGS, full genome sequencing, complete genome sequencing, or entire genome sequencing) is a laboratory process that determines the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time. Genome Catalogue provides a web interface to access to whole genome sequencing on the HiSeq X Ten platform is exclusively available to researchers. The researchers  will send their samples (DNA) for sequencing and the interface will provide analysis and processing of the sample data and deliver the sequenced data through a cloud based platform. <br>The application protects all data against cyber threats while staying compliant and provide vulnerability management, security configuration management and log intelligence which delivers superior detection, prevention and response solutions for cyber security threats. Our advanced security automation with enterprise integration will give fast actionable insights while our deep endpoint-intelligence gives the high fidelity asset-visibility with business-context.<br>URL : https://genome-catalogue.nci.org.au<br><br><i><u><b>Database Infrastructure on VMware</i></u></b><br>Responsible for database administration for a large and complex database infrastructure (13 servers) using Oracle, Postgres and MySQL database platforms on VMware virtualization platform. Using VMware addresses many difficult design problems such as scalability, high availability, and resource isolation that traditionally exist in the physical environment. With VMware features and tools, I have design database solutions that scale on demand to meet any throughput or organizational growth requirements; implement higher availability and disaster recovery solutions with less complexity; and leverage available hardware resources while maintaining full application isolationResponsibilities included performance & tuning, database design, data modeling, database installation, technical support. Tested, implemented, and supported database replication including both Postgres and MySQL Server Replication types in an editing environment.<br><br><i><u><b>Geoscience Database</i></u></b><br>Assisted with the design, implementation and support a multi-terabyte (48 TB) Geo Spatial Postgres Database for Geoscience Australia. Develop database solutions by designing proposed system; defining database physical structure and functional capabilities, security, back-up, and recovery specifications. Maintain database performance by identifying and resolving production and application development problems; calculating optimum values for parameters; evaluating, integrating, and installing new releases; completing maintenance. Developed an expert monitoring system for automatically detecting database performance problems.<br>In addition to building a close relationship I also defined the accountability resolutions to help long term problem solving pertaining to shared technical responsibilities.

Accountable for the following tasks: Initial project planning, Development of project scope, defining project guidelines, Resource coordination (internal and contracted), Testing coordination. Manage project plans and project resource requirements and budget. Design a distributed backup and recovery procedures for 48TB data to minimize the downtime.<br><br><i><u><b>LDAP Server</i></u></b><br>Strong experience in Enterprise Security Domain. In-depth knowledge of LDAP and Identity & Access management products. Designed LDAP Schemas, DITs to implement enterprise wide centralized repository. Responsible for designing, administrating creating and documenting the new ACL policies enterprise LDAP.<br><br><i><u><b>Web Application Security</i></u></b><br>Responsibilities include the coverage of information security technologies and markets, security program execution, advanced threats, network-based security technologies, mobile device security and cloud-related security issues. Specializing in network security assessments, perimeter defenses, log analysis, information security monitoring, and risk analysis. <br>Design a secure web infrastructure for both static and dynamic web applications from malicious attacks that may expose private information. Security is applied to the server level and application layer specifically to protect against unauthorized access and attacks.<br><br><i><u><b>Git Repository Setup</i></u></b><br>Setup a private Git Repository server to store all the puppet configuration files for setting up the cloud infrastructure. Git is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere if you are working in a team environment. All source code files stores in a secure environment with easily accessible online.<br>URL : https://vlrepos.nci.org.au<br><br><i><u><b>DB Backup</i></u></b><br>Providing highly available database and application infrastructure according to Business Continuity requirements using database replicationInstalled and configured backup agents according to specific settings for security and streamlined data flow. Organized regular audits of backup configurations to ensure quality of service. The application supports different kinds of database platform including Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, & SQL Server. <br>URL : https://dbmgmt.anu.edu.au<br><br><i><u><b>Software Registry (Grid Computing)</i></u></b><br>The software registry contains a list of all software around the APAC (Australian Partnership for Advance Computing) partner systems, including computational or data systems. The registry describes details of how to use the software on each system, including how to enable the software in your environment, and an example script of how to run the software as part of a batch job.
